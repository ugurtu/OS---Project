## What are we trying to do?
We will try to create a terminal based text editor, which includes other features than simple text creation, but we don't want to define these features at this time.

## How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
Nowadays there are a large number of text editors that specialize in all sorts of things. From word processors software like microsoft word to text editors for code like sublime. Limits are not known to us.

## What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
TThere is nothing new about our project per se. But we think this is okay, because our project is more about learning something new than being innovative. Especially in terms of text editors there is little room for improvement. But maybe during the implementation we will come up with ideas for features we would like to see in a text editor that are not available in the ones we know.
Our project will be successful because both of us were determined by the idea, in the introduction regarding the projects we both decided directly for a text editor.

## Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
Our group of interested parties is very broad.Nowadays, practically every person uses a word processor or text editor several times in their life. 

## What are the risks?
The biggest risk for us is probably not reaching our goal. Also bugs that could creep in can become a big risk. That's why we have to stick to a strict schedule and be as focused as possible.

## How much will it cost?
We estimate that the project will take us two to three weeks. 

## How long will it take?
See above.

## What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?
It would be nice if we had an already running program in the middle which doesn't have any extra feature yet, but you can already write and delete simple text, as well as save it. The final goal is clear, a text editor with which one beside the main task text writing also still further features possesses like, text mark etc..
